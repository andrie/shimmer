The `shimmer` package contains a discrete event simulation that explores how `shiny` processes behave at scale, typically orchestrated by *RStudio Connect* or *Shiny Server Pro*.

The underlying infrastructure of the simulation is provided by the `simmer` package (for discrete event simulations). In other words, `shimmer` simulates how Shiny apps scale by using the `simmer` simulation framework.

## Installation

The package is not yet on CRAN...

<!--
You can install the released version of pkg from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("pkg")
```
-->

... but you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/andrie/shimmer) using:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andrie/shimmer")
```
## Example

```{r, child = rprojroot::find_package_root_file("inst/vignette_child/child.Rmd")}
```
